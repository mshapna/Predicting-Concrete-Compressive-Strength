# Predicting-Concrete-Compressive-Strength

**Dataset :** Predicting Concrete Compressive Strength using Concrete Sensors
**Domain :** Construction

**Description:** The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given concrete mixture for a specific number of days was determined from lab.The data has 8 quantitative features (input variables), and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 data instances.

**Objective :** Model to predict compressive strength of Concrete using Machine Learning

**Steps :** This Machine Learning project uses feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

**Skills and Tools :** Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering
